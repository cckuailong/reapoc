Supercharge your WordPress email notifications using a WYSIWYG editor and shortcodes. Default and new notifications available. Increase power with Add-ons.

== Description ==

Better Notifications for WP is a simple but powerful plugin for beginners to advanced users that allows you to customise the email notifications that WordPress sends using the WYSIWYG editor and shortcodes. All of the default WordPress email notifications are available to customise as well as lots of new ones. You can choose to send notifications to individual users, multiple users, all users in a user role, multiple roles - you name it! You can also power-up your notifications with [Premium Add-ons](https://betternotificationsforwp.com/downloads/). Emails are sent out via your WordPress website (using `wp_mail`) but can be sent via SMTP using an appropriate 3rd party plugin should you wish.

Here's a quick walkthrough of the plugin in action:

= An Example: =
You want all the users in the Editor role to be notified via email when a new post is published and you'd like to customise it to include your logo along with the author's name and date / time it was published - with this plugin, that's easy.

If you'd like to see a notification in the list above, please drop me a line in the forum and I'll see what I can do to add it.

If you want to let users create their own email notifications, check out my other plugin: [Content Notify](https://contentnotify.com).

> Like this plugin? Please leave it [a great review](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/bnfw/reviews/?rate=5#new-post)! Don't think the plugin is worthy of 5 stars? Having problems? Let me know in the [forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/bnfw/) and I'll do my best to help.

> DISCLAIMER
> This is an incredibly useful and highly rated plugin however, it's possible that overuse or abuse of this plugin could upset your users by sending them too many notifications. By downloading / installing / using this plugin, you take full responsibility of the management / quantity / types of notifications that are sent out from it including abiding by any SPAM laws in your country / operating areas, dealing with / responding to subscription / unsubscription requests, complaints, and so on. I accept no liability or responsibility for SPAM or abuse of this plugin from the user(s) of or anyone that may receive notifications as a result of the use of this plugin. I'm trusting you, please don't abuse your users.



== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'bnfw' plugin folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory or install it via your WordPress Admin.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Use the settings in the new 'Notifications' Menu item in the sidebar to configure the plugin.
4. (Optional) Install a plugin to use SMTP instead of `wp_mail()`. I recommend [Post SMTP Mailer/Email Log](https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-smtp/).
5. Test by creating a notification with some [shortcodes](https://betternotificationsforwp.com/shortcodes/ "Shortcodes for use in Better Notifications for WP").



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

> Full Documentation for BNFW can be found [here](https://betternotificationsforwp.com/documentation/ "Documentation for Better Notifications for WP").

= Is this plugin compatible with the new Block Editor (Gutenberg) in WordPress 5? =

Yes and no. Most notifications work but full support can't be guaranteed for all notifications at the moment. Full support is on the roadmap but for the time being, I'd recommend using the [Classic Editor plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/) with BNFW.

= What are shortcodes? Where can I use them in this plugin? =

Shortcodes are text in square brackets that output content of some kind. For example, if you want to add the content of a post to a notification for 'New Post Published', you can use the `[post_content]` shortcode to display this in the email that is sent out.

Shortcodes can be used in the 'Subject' and 'Message Body' of your notifications, except for a select few (due to a restriction in WordPress).

> A handy list of shortcodes you can use is available [here](https://betternotificationsforwp.com/shortcodes/ "Shortcodes for use in Better Notifications for WP").

= What are some scenarios this plugin could be used for? =

* Outreach: A blog/news site with hundreds of subscribers and want to use it to alert them of new blog posts.
* Communication: A small, internal WordPress site and use it to alert staff of new posts or comments.
* Monitor: A website for an awesome new product or service and use it for notifications of pingbacks and trackbacks.
* Security: To receive alerts of password reset requests and their corresponding user.

The possibilities are endless!

= Does this plugin work with anti-spam plugins, such as Akismet? =

Yes! There is an option for suppressing comments marked as SPAM in the plugin settings.

= Does this plugin and the add-ons work with Multisite? =

Yes! Full support for WordPress Multisite was added in 1.6.13, alongside the release of the [Multisite Add-on](https://betternotificationsforwp.com/downloads/multisite/).

= Can users create their own email notifications? =

Not using BNFW. If you want to let users create their own email notifications, check out my other plugin: [Content Notify](https://contentnotify.com).

= Notifications aren't coming through! =

First of all, follow [this article](https://betternotificationsforwp.com/how-can-i-receive-the-best-support/) about how to find out what might be causing the problem. Additionally, please take a look at [this help document](https://betternotificationsforwp.com/documentation/getting-started/how-to-improve-email-delivery/) to see how you might improve email delivery when using Better Notifications for WP.

Many hosts place a limit on the number of emails that can be sent out within an hour so this may also cause some delay in emails arriving. [This article](https://support.mailpoet.com/knowledgebase/lists-of-hosts-and-their-sending-limits/) has a fairly extensive list of hosts and their corresponding email rate limits that's worth checking out. Alternatively, please check with your host directly to find out what your limit is.

If you're still having problems, please drop me a line in the [Free Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/bnfw) and I'll do my best to help.

= Some of my shortcodes aren't working! =

It's possible you're inserting a shortcode into a notification that cannot use it. For example: the 'New Category' email notification cannot use any of the author or time shortcodes as WordPress only stores the category name, category slug and category description in the database by default. It's also worth checking the spelling and underscores in any shortcodes as well as if they are wrapped in square brackets `[]`.

= Other emails from WordPress / other plugins are being messed up! =

WordPress, by default, sends all emails in Plain Text. If you'd like to include code or use the WYSIWYG editor as part of Better Notifications for WP in your emails, you can change this to HTML using the global setting in Better Notification for WordPress. This can be found under the 'Notifications > Settings' screen. Changing this global email format setting will affect how all emails are sent out from WordPress however, so you may experience formatting issues with emails sent out from other plugins if you change the email format setting in this way. If you do, change this setting to Plain Text. You can also set the email format on a per-notification basis when setting-up a new Notification. The caveat is that WordPress will only either allow setting the email format globally (for all emails) or individually for anything that's non-transactional.

= Custom Post Type 'X' isn't showing in the list of available custom post types =

This is most likely because it's `public` setting is set to `false`. Try changing this and see if it shows up in the list. If the custom post type has been created by a plugin and is set to private (such as [TablePress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tablepress/ "TablePress")), you'll need to get in touch with the plugin author to see if they'll consider changing it to public instead so that BNFW can send out notifications for it.

= Can I translate this plugin? =

Yes, of course! The plugin is completely translation-friendly and if you send me your .po file, I'll make sure to include it in the plugin and credit you in the changelog.

= 1.6.12 - 1st March 2018 =

Full details are on the [Shortcodes](https://betternotificationsforwp.com/documentation/notifications/shortcodes/) documentation page.
