One plugin to save your AdSense account from Click Bombings and Invalid Click Activities

== Description ==

AdSense Invalid Click Protector a.k.a. AICP plugin will help you to save your Google AdSense account from unusual invalid click activities and click bombings. As per the Google AdSense terms, Google doesn't take any responsibility towards these invalid click activities or click bombings and always point the finger towards the AdSense publisher, giving him/her all the blames. Now it is time to end this problem, once and for all.

> **Important Note About Touch Screen Support:** This plugin doesn't work on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, because this hardware uses a touchscreen instead of a mouse as click input. This design makes the boundary monitoring trick ineffective.

> **Important Note:** From v1.1.0 this plugin __will only work with__ AdSense ad code or any ad code that shows iframe based ads. Normal affiliate ad codes will be tracked anymore. If you want to track affiliate ad codes like `<a href="http://example.com"><img src="/some.jpg" /></a>`, please use v1.0.6 of this plugin. v1.1.0+ code will not work that way. To know why I had to do this, check the FAQ section.

> **Important Note:** This plugin uses the free API version of [IP-API.com](http://ip-api.com/) which allows 150 req/min. If you have a high traffic website, this 150 requests per minute will not be enough for you and you may see `503 Error` on your site due to free API restrictions. If you have a high traffic website which may generate more than 150 requests per minute, I will recommend you to grab the [PRO Version of IP-API](https://signup.ip-api.com/) and enter your Pro API key in the General Settings page of this plugin.

= Some FAQs =

**How to use this plugin with your site?**

I know there are many WordPress plugin where you basically paste your AdSense code and it shows your ad at various position of your website. But unfortunately it is not humanly possible for me to check every single plugin of such out there or contact each plugin developer. Here I'm showing you how to incorporate the **AdSense Invalid Click Protector (AICP)** plugin with your website's ad code, so that both other plugin developers and normal users who use custom codes to show up their ads can take advantage of this.

To use the AdSense Invalid Click Protector plugin with your ad code you basically have to do 2 simple things.

1. Put a `if( aicp_can_see_ads() ) { /* return your ad code here */ }` block before returning your ad code to the front end
2. Wrap your ad code within a simple `div` tag like this `<div class="aicp">...your ad code goes here...</div>`

Personally I create various WordPress shortcodes for various ad units that I use on my personal website. It is extremely easy to create shortcodes for your ad units while taking the advantage of AdSense Invalid Click Protector Plugin. Let me show you how to create a WordPress shortcode very easily.

To create a shortcode the first thing you need to do is, go to the `functions.php` file of your theme or your child theme and at the end of your file put any of the following code.

If you are using a PHP version < 5.3, you can create a shortcode in the following way:

`add_shortcode( 'your_shortcode_name', 'your_shortcode_function_name' );
function your_shortcode_function_name() {
    if( aicp_can_see_ads() ) { // This part will show ads to your non-banned visitors
        $adCode = '<div class="aicp"><!-- Don\'t forget to add this div with aicp class -->
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <!-- AdSense Responsive Ad Code -->
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
             style="display:block"
             data-ad-client="ca-pub-1234567890"
             data-ad-slot="0987654321"
             data-ad-format="auto"></ins>
        <script>
        (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
        </div><!-- end of the aicp div -->';
        return $adCode;
    } else { // Anything within this part will be shown to your banned visitors or to the blocked country visitors
        return '<div class="error">You have been blocked from seeing ads.</div>';
    }
}`

If you are using PHP version >= 5.3, you don't need to give a function name, instead you can take advantage of of anonymous function like this way:

`add_shortcode( 'your_shortcode_name', function() {
    if( aicp_can_see_ads() ) { // This part will show ads to your non-banned visitors
        $adCode = '<div class="aicp"><!-- Don\'t forget to add this div with aicp class -->
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <!-- AdSense Responsive Ad Code -->
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
             style="display:block"
             data-ad-client="ca-pub-1234567890"
             data-ad-slot="0987654321"
             data-ad-format="auto"></ins>
        <script>
        (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
        </div><!-- end of the aicp div -->';
        return $adCode;
    } else { // Anything within this part will be shown to your banned visitors or to the blocked country visitors
        return '<div class="error">You have been blocked from seeing ads.</div>';
    }
} );`

**Please Note:** if you want, you can completely ignore the `else {}` block above in case you don't wanna show anything special to the blocked visitors.

**How can I know what PHP version I am using?**

You can install the [WP Server Stats](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-server-stats/) plugin in your website which will show you many important information about your hosting environment including what PHP version you are currently using.

**Can this plugin be used with other ad medias?**

No It is not. This plugin will only work with AdSense ads or any ad media that shows iframe based ads. Recently Google has tweaked there ad code which makes merely impossible to support both iframe based ads like AdSense and non-iframe based ads, like affiliate ads.
In case of affiliate ads, there is generally no click bombing issue, that is why from v1.1.0, AICP will only support iframe based ads and not general affiliate ads. Sorry guys! In case you want to use AICP just for affiliate ads, I will recommend you to download v1.0.6 of the plugin from the [old archive](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ad-invalid-click-protector/developers/).

**Will it help me from stop clicking on my own ads?**

No, you are not supposed to click on your own ads. If you want you can use adblock in your browser to save yourself from accidental clicking on your own ads. 

**Languages**

AdSense Invalid Click Protector plugin is 100% translation ready. Right now it only has the English translation in it but over time with the community help I hope this plugin will have many language in it's language directory.
