= COMPATIBILTY =

= GUTENBERG BLOCK =
Using the Gutenberg Editor. Use the Page View Count Block to add the counter to any page or post content.  Block search for 'Page Views' or selecting the block from the a3rev Blocks menu.

Adding the Page Views block to your content automatically deactivates the Global Page View counter on the post or page.

= ELEMENTOR TEMPLATES =
Fully compatible with Elementor templates. Add counter via Shortcode or widget to any template.

= DEVELOPERS =

On the plugins dashboard in the + Page Views Count Function options box you will find the Page Views Count functions and notes on how to use them. 

* Use to manually add Page views count to any content or object in the theme. 
* Use to add page View Count to any content that is not create using WordPress custom post / taxonomy type. 
* Use to create a custom position of the Page Views Count 
* Functions support echo and return parameters when getting visitor stats on any variable.

= TROUBLESHOOTING =

* The number 1 support request we get about the plugin is that it double or triple counts page or post loads. Yes it does and if you see that it is a Red Flag that you have a misconfiguration or bug in your theme or a plugin. Page Views Count does exactly that - counts each time the page or post is loading in the browser - if its counting twice it is because the browser is double loading the page. That is a bad thing and you or your developer needs to fix that.
