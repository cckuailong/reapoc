> "Great plugin & excellent email support! Happy customer!<br>
> I recently purchased the pro versions of the sticky menu & sticky element plug-ins for my new website. I wanted to give visitors permanent visibility of the email-us contact form and the call-us button to maximise the opportunity for them to act instantly when prompted by features in my web content. <br>Both were easily configured and live on the website in no time. They can also be configured so that they are not overly obtrusive. I am 100% pleased with my purchase and the customer support was instant i.e. no waiting for a reply to my emails. Well done Premio!"<br><br>
