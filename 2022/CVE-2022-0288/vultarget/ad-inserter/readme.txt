Supports all kinds of ads including **Google AdSense**, **Google Ad Manager** (DFP - DoubleClick for publishers), contextual **Amazon Native Shopping Ads**, **Media.net** , **Infolinks** and **rotating banners.**

>
> I'm blown AWAY with the power and flexibility of it.
>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Settings for ... =

Check <a href="https://adinserter.pro/documentation/common-settings" target="_blank">common settings</a>

= Does Ad Inserter insert any internal ads? =

No revenue sharing and no such thing as "internal ads" or "our ads" on your website. Period. What you configure is what will be inserted (+ some internal scripts for plugin features).
Ad Inserter is free, open source plugin and inserts only the code you configure (blocks, Header, Footer). The code you see is the code that will be inserted. Please check page source code before you make any conclusion.
Of course, if you configure block with some JavaScript ad code, then this code may insert some additional code or show ads. But please, don't blame the plugin for this.
You can also use this plugin to insert code for AdSense Auto ads on each page (usually in the header). However, **the exact placement of ads will be done by the ad code, not Ad Inserter!**
[https://adinserter.pro/documentation/adsense-ads#auto-ads](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/adsense-ads#auto-ads)

The easiest way to check inserted blocks is to use **Label blocks** debugging function:
[https://adinserter.pro/documentation/debugging](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/debugging)

Please note that when you disable the plugin you also disable insertion of all codes and blocks you have configured.
Therefore, if your issues go away when you disable the plugin THIS DOES NOT INDICATE any issue with the plugin! You need to try to [disable individual codes](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/debugging#back-end) to see which one is causing trouble.

= What is remote debugging? =

Ad Inserter is basically used to insert ad codes according to the settings.
When the code is not inserted where it is expected or the inserted HTML/Javascript code does not display anything, you as the site administrator can use [debugging functions](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/debugging) to diagnose insertions.

Those tools are normally available to the administrator of the website and are shown as a menu item in the admin bar.
When you will ask for help on the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/ad-inserter/) we'll ask you to enable remote debugging so the support team will be able to access debugging tools via url.

This will allow the support team to:

*   Label inserted blocks - a border will be drawn around the blocks and a bar will be shown above them so the support will be able to see if/where and which blocks are inserted.
*   Show possible positions for automatic insertion - in places where WP hooks are called a label is placed so the support will be able to see where your theme calls WP hooks
*   See processing log - the log is inserted as HTML comment at the end of the page and shows data and settings used by Ad Inserter and the log of the plugin functions/hooks called during page generation - the support will be able to see the reason why some block was not inserted, how many times `the_content` hook is called, etc.
*   Disable block insertions - sometimes the issues are caused by the inserted code - this way the support will be able to quickly disable insertions of Ad Inserter blocks to see the difference

Pages with debugging info are not cached - the debugging process will not be visible to anybody else. Once the help is not needed anymore you can disable remote debugging.

= I have installed code for AdSense and I see ads placed at random positions. =

You are probably using code for [AdSense Auto ads](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/adsense-ads#auto-ads).

Auto ads (known also as Page Level Ads) is a code that you insert on every page once and it will automatically display ads on positions chosen by the code.
The code uses Google's machine learning to pick the best placements on your pages to show adverts.

Auto ads may not be suitable for some WordPress themes or layouts. In such cases it is easier to place ads at wanted locations by using [normal AdSense code](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/adsense-ads#ad-unit) and specifying exact locations where the code should be inserted.

= I have installed code for AdSense but the ad blocks are blank. =

Blank ad block means that the code is inserted properly only the ad code doesn't display ads.
Please check <a href="https://adinserter.pro/documentation/troubleshooting#ads-not-displayed">Ads Not Displayed</a> for more information. You can also try other ad networks.

= What is GDPR? =

The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is a regulation in European Union (EU) on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA) that was designed to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe. If you collect personal information from any EU citizen (within or outside the EU), you must first obtain explicit and unambiguous consent.

= GDPR compliance: What cookies does the plugin use =

Ad Inserter itself does not use cookies except for ad blocking detection when you use delayed action.

In this case 3 cookies may be used (to store pageviews and action settings): `aiADB`, `aiADB_PV` and `aiADB_PR`. However, no personal data is stored in the cookies.

Of course, the ads you may insert with the plugin may use own cookies - please check with ad networks for details.

= How to display a GDPR compliant cookie message? =

You can use any plugin for GDPR compliance / cookie consent. You can also prevent inserting ad codes and displaying ads before the consent is given - check [How to show ads based on visitors' consent](https://adinserter.pro/faq/gdpr-compliance-cookies-consent).

PLEASE NOTE: Installing GDPR plugin alone does not make your site GDPR compliant. Since ads you insert may use various cookies, you may need to make sure you have necessary configurations in place. Please check next question regarding showing ads based on visitor's consent.

= How to show ads based on visitor's consent? =

Ad Inserter supports inserting ad codes (and showing ads) based on cookies or cookie values. You can define cookie conditions by black/whitelisting *Url parameters* (where also [cookies are checked](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/black-and-white-lists#cookies)).

PLEASE NOTE: If you are using caching (very likely) you also need to set **Dynamic blocks** to **Client-side insert** (tab &#9881; / tab General) in order to check cookies in visitor's browser and not when the page is generated.

For example, If you are using one of the following plugins for the consents you need to **whitelist the following cookie and value in Url parameter list**:

*   [CookieYes | GDPR Cookie Consent & Compliance Notice](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cookie-law-info/) - Whitelist `cookielawinfo-checkbox-advertisement=yes`
*   [Cookie Notice for GDPR](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cookie-notice/) - Whitelist `cookie_notice_accepted=true`
*   [Cookie Consent](https://wordpress.org/plugins/uk-cookie-consent/) - Whitelist `catAccCookies=1`
*   [Quantcast Choice](https://wordpress.org/plugins/quantcast-choice/) or any other solution based on IAB TCF 2.0 - For Google ads (AdSense) whitelist `tcf-google, tcf-no-gdpr`

Make sure **Dynamic blocks** are set to **Client-side insert** (tab &#9881; / tab General). For more details please check [How to show ads based on visitors' consent](https://adinserter.pro/faq/gdpr-compliance-cookies-consent).

= Will Ad Inserter work when jQuery is deferred? =

Yes!

Make sure **Wait for jQuery** is set to Enabled in [general plugin settings](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/plugin-settings#wait-for-jquery) (tab &#9881; / tab General).

= How to minimize redirects? =

Ad Inserter does not do any redirects, it only inserts ad codes as configured.

If you see any report (for example from GTmetrix) suggesting to minimize redirects you need to first check where the redirects are located (on which page or domain) - if they are on other (ad network) domains you don't control, then there is nothing you can do (nobody except ad network can change this).

For details please check this page: [How to optimize plugin settings](https://adinserter.pro/faq/how-to-optimize-plugin-settings)

= What is plugin usage tracking? =

When enabled, the information regarding WordPress environment and Ad Inserter usage will be collected and sent to plugin developers (once per month and on events like plugin activation/deactivation). See detailed explanation below.

= Privacy Policy - Plugin Usage Tracking =

When enabled, the information regarding WordPress environment and Ad Inserter usage will be collected and sent to plugin developers (once per month and on events like plugin activation/deactivation).

This is completely optional and can be disabled at any time. So if you have opted in (by clicking Allow when asked for permission) and now you would like to disable tracking, you should go to tab &#9881; / tab General, select **Disable** for Plugin usage tracking and save settings.

If this setting is not available then you have not selected any option yet - **tracking is disabled unless explicitly enabled** by clicking Allow when asked for permission (or when this setting is set to Enable).

What data is collected: Ad Inserter version, activation status, number of active blocks, date of installation, date of last saved settings, status of review notice and remote debugging, block class name, location, website url and name, WordPress version, language, text direction, charset, number of posts, active theme and version, list of installed plugins, PHP version, server name, IP address (used to determine country), site count for multisite installations, deactivation reasons and details (if provided).

Ad Inserter is only a plugin for WordPress content management software. It works together with WordPress, other installed plugins and selected theme.

This data provides information to make the plugin to be compatible with as many environments as possible, to test the plugin with commonly used plugins and themes, to understand why users deativate (and uninstall) the plugin and to get ideas to make improvements to the plugin.

If you are not happy to reveal this information and you have opted in, simply disable usage tracking as described above.

**Your decision will be respected.**
