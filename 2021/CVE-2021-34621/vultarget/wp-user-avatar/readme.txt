### Excellent Features of ProfilePress

= Custom Frontend Forms =

Create amazing login, user registration, password reset and edit profile forms with our drag-and-drop and advanced builders. Your members will never have to see your WordPress admin panel. Everything is handled on the frontend.

* **User Registration Forms** – Let users signup via a custom registration form.
* **Login & Password Reset Forms** – Allow users to log in and reset their passwords.
* **User Dashboard** – My Account page and edit profile forms for users to manage their profile details and account settings.
* **Automatic Login & Redirections** – Automatically log in users after they register and redirect them after they sign in, log out and reset their passwords.
* Add login, logout, register and profile links to your website navigation menu that will change based on whether the user is logged in or not.

= User Profiles & Member Directories =

Add beautiful user profiles to your site that display the profile picture and information of your users.​ And create searchable and filterable member directories allowing users to find each other.

We also provide shortcodes to display users avatars and allow users to upload their profile pictures from the front-end of your site.​

= Advanced and Drag-and-Drop Form Builder =

We took the pain out of creating user profiles, member directories, forms with our intuitive drag-and-drop builder.

We also provide an advanced form builder that gives you the flexibility to build any type of form. With knowledge of HTML, you code the form in combination with our expressive shortcodes, make it pretty with CSS and we handle the rest.

= Customisable Pre-Built Templates =

Never start from scratch again. ProfilePress comes with several beautiful, customizable pre-built templates for user profile, member directory and forms to help you save even more time.

= Access & Content Restriction =

ProfilePress gives you fine-grained control over what content your users can see based on your protection rules. You can restrict access to pages, child pages, posts, custom post types, categories, tags and custom taxonomies based on their user roles and logged-in status.

ProfilePress also lets you:

* Disable the admin bar and restrict access to the WordPress dashboard based on user roles.​
* Redirect the WordPress default login page (wp-login.php) to your custom login, registration page and password reset pages.

= Email Customizer =

Customize the email templates for each email that can be sent to users and administrators. You also have the flexibility of changing the sender name and email address as well as activate and deactivate the email type that can be sent.
