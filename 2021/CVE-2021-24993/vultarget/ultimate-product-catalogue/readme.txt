The Ultimate Product Catalog comes with several features that will allow you to offer a great experience your customers and visitors. These include the ability to set up a catalog overview page, which shows a thumbnail of each product category and lets people click through to view just those products, a separate shortcode to display a list of products outside the catalog (perfect for creating a featured products section), a price slider to add to the filtering, and much more!

`[product-catalogue id="X"] or [product-catalog id="X"]
`

Simply insert either of the shortcodes above (replacing the "X" with the actual ID of your product catalog) to add a product catalog, with product filters, to any page.

The product catalog comes with a Custom CSS feature that lets you modify the styling of your catalog to further fit the look of your site. On top of this, make your product catalog easy to browse, sort and update with advanced product filter options in your catalog sidebar as well as categories and sub-categories.

Perfect to create a product catalog for your store, art gallery, restaurant and more!

= Additional Features =

The following are some of the other great features included with the Ultimate Product Catalog plugin:

* Product catalog overview mode, showing category or sub-category images (such as brands, etc.)
* Choose currency symbol and location
* Search product catalog functions with AJAX
* Price slider that lets you filter the catalog for products that match exact price criteria
* Easy-to-use product catalog attributes like "starting_layout" and "excluded_layout"
* Display a specific product category in your product catalog using URL filtering
* Thumbnail support option, which displays a smaller version of your product image, to help with page load times
* Options page that makes it easy to customize product catalog features
* Breadcrumbs

The Ultimate Product Catalog is also a great solution for those who are running affiliate stores, in which you link out to products for sale on other sites. With the ability to specify a unique link for each product (using the "Product Link" field), you can insert your affiliate link and then set it up so that, when someone clicks on a product in your catalog, they are brought to that link instead of the product page in the plugin. You get all the benefits and functionality of the Ultimate Product Catalog while being able to sell as an affiliate.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I display my product catalog? If I have more than one product catalog, what do I do? =

Put the following product catalog shortcode on whatever page you’re trying to put the product catalog on: ‘[product-catalogue id=’X’]’ or [product-catalog id=’X’]. Replace the ‘X’ with the ID of your product catalog. This can be found by clicking on your product catalog. The product catalog ID  is beside the product catalog name on the product catalog’s details page. You can also copy the product catalog shortcode directly from the “Catalogues” page.

To display one of your product catalogs, use the corresponding attribute ‘id='X'’ in the product-catalogue shortcode to specify that product catalog, where 'X' is replaced with the product catalog ID.

= Can my products be in more than one category or sub-category? =

No, products can only be in a single category and sub-category. Products can have as many tags desired, since tags are used to represent product attributes, and only tags that are used for a product within a product catalog are displayed in the product catalog sidebar.

= Can I load my product catalog with a layout other than the default "Thumbnail" product catalog layout? =

Add the attribute starting_layout=‘LAYOUT’ for your product catalog, where LAYOUT is replaced with the layout you would like to be the starting product catalog layout (List or Detail are the two options currently).

= I only want to display one product catalog layout and to remove the layout bar at the top from my product catalog? =

The attribute ‘excluded_layouts’ lets you stop one or more layouts from being displayed for your product catalog. It accepts a comma separated list of layouts you wish to exclude from your product catalog. For example, [product-catalogue id=‘X’ excluded_layouts=‘Thumbnail,List’] would make your product catalog display only the "Detail" view.

To remove the layout bar from your product catalog, you can try adding the following into your "Custom CSS" box for your product catalog (where the colour matches the colour of the product catalog you are using):

‘.Blue-prod-cat-header-div {display: none;}’

= My product description gets cut off even though I have changed the max characters for my product catalog, how can I fix this? =

There is a text area labelled "Custom CSS" when you click on the product catalog that you're editing. Try adding this to it:  ‘.prod-cat-addt-details-desc-div {max-height:none;}’

= How do I remove the sidebar from my product catalog? =

You can use the attribute [sidebar=‘No'] in the product-catalogue shortcode to remove the sidebar from a product catalog.

= Why aren’t my products uploading from the spreadsheet? =

There are a number of reasons why products might not be uploading correctly.
First, make sure that you’re uploading either a .xls or .xlsx file type (not .csv).
Second, make sure that you’ve written all of your field names correctly (Name, Slug, Description, Price, Image, Category, Sub-Category, Tags), especially custom fields, which need to be exactly the same as the field name.
Third, make sure that you don’t have any columns that have been edited unintentionally (which gives an “incorrect field name” error).

= How do I get custom changes I’ve made to the product page layout or the custom fields I’ve added in the product details to display? =

On  the “Options” page the “Custom Product Page” needs to be set to “Yes” for custom layout to display.

= How do I sort the order of the products within the catalog? =

You can arrange the order of the products by dragging and dropping the products on the “Catalogue Details” page .

= How do I translate the product catalog into my language? =
A great place to start learning about how to translate a plugin is at the link below: <https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/how-to-translate-a-wordpress-plugin>

Once translated, you'll need to put the translated catalog mo- and po- files directly in the lang folder and make sure they are named properly for your localization.
If you do translate the product catalog, other users would love to have access to the files in your language. You can send them to us at Contact@EtoileWebDesign.com, and we’ll be sure they’re included in a future release.

= What is enabled in the 'Premium' version? =

The premium version includes a lot of great features including: the ability to add over 100 products, additional product images, SEO friendly product catalog URLs, product tags and custom fields for product catalog sorting, custom catalog product pages, a minimalist product catalog layout option and more!

* Super responsive tabbed layout with customizable tabs
* Drag-and-drop catalog product pages layout
* Lightbox, product inquiry form (using Contact Form 7 or WPForms) and product reviews (using <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-reviews/'>Ultimate Reviews</a>)

- <strong>5.0.0 is here with huge improvements to catalog performance, usability, design and layout, UI/UX, filtering, and so much more!</strong>
- <strong>This update includes a big change to the construction of the plugin, so please take caution and test before updating on a live site (or wait a few days before updating in case some minor corrective updates need to be released).</strong>
- <strong>Please also double check after updating to see if the plugin was automatically re-activated. If not, you just need to manually click the Activate button.</strong>
- <strong>The class names/IDs/selectors have been standardized across the whole plugin. This was necessary and long overdue. However, as a consequence, it is quite likely that, if you are using custom CSS, some or many of the selectors will have been updated. If you find some of your custom CSS no longer working, please just provide us with your existing custom CSS and we will provide you with updated CSS to do the same.</strong>
