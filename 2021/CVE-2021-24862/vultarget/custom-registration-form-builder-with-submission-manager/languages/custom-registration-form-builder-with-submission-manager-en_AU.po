"This new section will allow you to create tasks which run in the background "
"and process actions on form submissions. Each task is attached to a specific "
"form and requires setting rule(s). The tasks are scheduled using WordPress "
"native cron system. Please note, scheduling too many tasks simultaneously "
"may stress resources of shared or moderately powered servers. Automation is "
"another step in our plan to keep providing you greater control over your "
"forms. You will keep seeing new automation rules and actions in coming "
"months. Good luck!"
