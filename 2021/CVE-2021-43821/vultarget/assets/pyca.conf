# pyCA Configuration
##

# Notice: Most properties do have sensible defaults. Things that should be
# changed are those properties that are not commented out in this file.


[agent]

# Name of the capture agent
# Type: string
# Default: pyca@<hostname>
name             = 'pyca-container'

# How often (in seconds) should the capture agent try to get an updated
# schedule from the core.
# Type: integer
# Default: 60
#update_frequency = 60

# For how many days in advance shall the capture agent get the schedule. A
# smaller value will be faster and less memory consuming. Setting this to 0
# will make pyCA request all scheduled events.
# Type: integer
# Default: 14
#cal_lookahead    = 14

# In backup mode, the pyCA will not register itself or ingest anything to the
# core. It is useful if you want pyCA act as backup to another capture agent.
# To get the events for another agent, also set the name of the agent to the
# one that should be backed up.
# Type: boolean
# Default: False
#backup_mode      = False

# Location of the database file to cache scheduled events in and keep a
# history of recordings. This can be any database supported by SQLAlchemy.
# Type: String
# Default: sqlite:///pyca.db
#database = sqlite:///pyca.db


[capture]

# Base directory to store recordings in. For each recording a subdirectory
# will be created.
# Type: string
# Default: ./recordings
directory        = './recordings'

# Command to use for capturing. This may also be a script file. The only
# requirement is that the command terminates itself in time.
#
# Possible string substitutions you can use are:
#   {{time}}        Time to capture in seconds
#   {{dir}}         Directory to put recordings in
#   {{name}}        Autogenerated name of the recording.
#   {{previewdir}}  Directory to put preview images in
#
# Examples:
#
# Record pulseaudio source using FFmpeg:
#   ffmpeg -f pulse -i default -t %(time)s -c:a flac -ac 1 {{dir}}/{{name}}.flac
#
# Record video stream on a Reaspberry Pi using the camera module:
#   raspivid -n -t %(time)s000 -b 6000000 -fps 30 -o {{dir}}/{{name}}.h264
#
# Record audio using arecord (alsa recorder):
#   arecord -c 2 -d {{time}} -r 44100 -f S16_LE -D hw:0 {{dir}}/{{name}}.wav
#
# Run custom shell script:
#   /opt/rec.sh "{{dir}}" {{name}} {{time}}
#
# For more examples, have a look at the pyCA wiki.
#
# Type: string
# Default: ffmpeg -nostats -re -f lavfi -r 25 -i testsrc -t {{time}} {{dir}}/{{name}}.webm'
command          = 'ffmpeg -nostats -re -f lavfi -r 25 -i testsrc -f lavfi -i sine -t {{time}} {{dir}}/{{name}}.webm'

# Flavors of output files produced by the capture command. One flavors should
# be specified for every output file.
# Type: list of strings (write as '...', '...')
# Default: 'presenter/source'
#flavors          = 'presenter/source'

# Output files produces by the capture command.
# Type: list of strings (write as '...', '...')
# Default: '{{dir}}/{{name}}.webm'
#files            = '{{dir}}/{{name}}.webm'

# Base directory for preview images generated by the capture command. They can
# be as confidence monitoring in the web ui.
# Type: String
# Default: ./recordings
#preview_dir      = './recordings'

# List of preview images to be included in the web ui.
# Type: list of strings (write as '...', '...')
# Default:
#preview          =

# Custom signal value that is sent to the capture process to gracefully finish the
# recording. Common signal values can be found in 'man 7 signal'.
# Type: Integer
# Default: 2 (SIGINT)
#sigcustom        = 2

# Time in seconds after an events end when the custom signal is sent to the capture
# process. Setting this to -1 will disable the signal.
# Type: Integer
# Default: -1 (disabled)
#sigcustom_time   = -1

# Time in seconds after an events end when a SIGTERM is sent to the capture
# process to shut it down in case it does not do that by itself. Setting this
# to -1 will disable the signal.
# Type: Integer
# Default: -1 (disabled)
#sigterm_time     = -1

# Time in seconds after an events end when a SIGKILL is sent to the capture
# process to ensure it terminates and does not block further recordings. Note
# that setting this lower than `sigterm_time` will set this to `sigterm_time`.
# Setting this to -1 will disable the signal.
# Type: Integer
# Default: 120
#sigkill_time     = 120

# An additional exit code to 0 indicating that the capture process has
# been completed successfully.
# Type: integer
# Default: 0
#exit_code        = 0


[ingest]

# Delete recordings after they have been successfully uploaded. This does only
# apply to the content of the recording directory, not the metadata.
# Type: boolean
# Default: False
#delete_after_upload = False


[server]

# Base URL of the admin server. This corresponds to the
# org.opencastproject.server.url setting of Opencast.
# Type: string
# Default: https://develop.opencast.org
url              = 'http://opencast:8080'

# Analogue of -k, --insecure option in curl. Allows insercure SSL connections
# while using HTTPS on the server.
# Type: boolean
# Default: False
#insecure         = False

# Authentication Method
#
# Historically, capture agents use HTTP digest authentication. The downside of
# this is, that all users need to be specified in the backend configuration
# files. Instead, HTTP Basic authentication can be used with front-end users
# (users created in the web interface). Whatever you use, make sure the user
# has appropriate rights (e.g. ROLE_CAPTURE_AGENT) to communicate with the
# capture agent API in Opencast.
#
# Type: options
# Allowed values: basic, digest
# Default: digest
#auth_method = 'digest'

# Username for the admin server
# Type: string
# Default: opencast_system_account
username         = 'opencast_system_account'

# Password for the admin server
# Type: string
# Default: CHANGE_ME
password         = 'CHANGE_ME'

# HTTPS certificates for verification. If signed by a certificate authority
# through an intermediate certificate, make sure to import the whole
# certificate chain.
# Type: string
# Default: ''
#certificate     = ''

# Type: string
# Default: admin
#username         = 'admin'

# Password for the pyCA web interface
# Type: string
# Default: opencast
#password         = 'opencast'

# How often (seconds) should the web interface refresh itself.
# Type: integer
# Default: 10
#refresh_rate     = 10

# URL where the web interface is reachable. This will be sent to the Matterhorn
# core and displayed in the admin interface.
# Type: string
# Default: http://localhost:5000
#url              = 'http://localhost:5000'

# Command to execute for gathering logs which are then published via the
# web API. The command is executed whenever the JSON API endpoint is
# requested.
# Defining no command will effectively disable the endpoint.
# Type: string
# Default: no command
#log_command = 'journalctl --no-hostname -n 50 -u "pyca*"'


[logging]

# Log to the system logger. Note that this will use /dev/log which may not be
# available on non Linux systems.
# Type: boolean
# Default: False
#syslog           = False

# Log to stderr
# Type: boolean
# Default: True
#stderr           = True

#format           = [%(name)s:%(lineno)s:%(funcName)s()] [%(levelname)s] %(message)s
