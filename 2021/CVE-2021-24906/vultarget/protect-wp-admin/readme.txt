== Description ==

WP Protect Admin Plugin has Provide Extra Secutiry Layer to Protect Your WordPress Admin Area. Using this plugin you can safe your site using necessary features like change default admin login url (/wp-admin) user name & login history log.

If you run a WordPress website, you should absolutely use "protect-wp-admin" to secure it against hackers.

Protect WP-Admin fixes a glaring security hole in the WordPress community: the well-known problem of the admin panel URL.

Protect WP-Admin solves this problem by allowing administrators to customize their admin panel URL and blocking the default links.

Administrators will be able to change default login page url "sitename.com/wp-admin" to something like "sitename.com/custom-string", so after that guest user will be redirected to the homepage.

The plugin also comes with some access filters, allowing Administrator to restrict guest and registered users access to wp-admin, just in case you want some of your editors to log in the classic way.
