= Don't risk your backups on anything less =

Your WordPress backups are worth the entire investment you've made in your website. The day may come when you get hacked, when something goes wrong with an update, your server crashes or your hosting company goes bust - without good backups, you lose everything. Would you entrust all your hard work to a backup plugin with only a few thousand downloads, mixed reviews or no professional support?

Believe us: writing a reliable backup plugin that works consistently across the huge range of WordPress deployments is hard.

UpdraftPlus works. We'll keep your backups safe.

= Why you should backup your website. =

WordPress like any CMS can be vulnerable to things such as server crashes, hacking, security flaws, bad plugin or theme updates and insecure web hosts. If anything happened to your website, it would cost you dearly in time, money and reputation.

Whilst other security measures are essential, backups are the ultimate insurance: they mean that, if the worst were to happen, your website (plus all related files and databases) stay safe, and can be restored in no time.

You could always create your own manual backups- but using backup plugin is infinitely quicker, simpler and safer. Life's busy enough! With UpdraftPlus, you can simply "set and forget", scheduling in automatic backups to save you time, work and hassle.

= How UpdraftPlus compares with other backup plugins: =

UpdraftPlus is the most highly-rated and popular plugin out there - and for good reason. Not only is it comprehensive in terms of its features, but it's also easy and intuitive to use.

Unlike many other plugins, UpdraftPlus:

* Restores, as well as backing up
* Backs up to more cloud options than any others
* Allows you to set up automatic backup schedules, for the ultimate in convenience

= Are you multi-lingual? Can you translate? =

Are you able to translate UpdraftPlus into another language? Are you ready to help speakers of your language? UpdraftPlus Backup/Restore itself is ready and waiting - the only work needed is the translating. The translation process is easy, and web-based - go here for instructions: <a href="https://updraftplus.com/translate/">https://updraftplus.com/translate/</a>. (Or if you're an expert WordPress translator already, then just pick out the .pot file from the wp-content/plugins/updraftplus/languages/ directory - if you scan for translatable strings manually, then you need to get these functions: _x(), __(), _e(), _ex(), log_e()).

= How do I install UpdraftPlus? =

Here are the installation guidelines from our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ReY7Z19h2I">YouTube channel</a> or from <a href="https://updraftplus.com/download/">our website</a>.

= Where are your other FAQs, other than the few found here? =

Here: <a href="https://updraftplus.com/faqs/">https://updraftplus.com/faqs/</a> (by keeping them in one place, we make sure they don't fall out-of-date!).

= Is there any way to make managing multiple website backups easier? =

Yes! We’ve developed a brilliant new plugin that allows you to backup, update and manage all of your website remotely from one central location. It’s called UpdraftCentral, and it comes in 2 different forms:

* UpdraftCentral (free, self-hosted)
* UpdraftCentral Premium (fully-hosted by us and "ready-to-go"; self-hosted version also available)

= What if I have a problem / need support ? =

You can find us in <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/updraftplus">the WordPress support forum for this plugin</a>. However, before you get in touch with problems, please do ensure that you read through all the FAQs and that you’ve updated to the latest release of our plugin. If you’re a paying customer, you should <a href="https://updraftplus.com/support/">go to our support page, here.</a>

It helps greatly if you can include the backup log and as much other information as possible in your report, for example, the PHP version, your website, the error description, how you got to the page that caused it, any other relevant plugins you have installed, plus any other information that might be of use.

To find the backup log: there are links to download the logs on the UpdraftPlus settings page- or you may be emailed it. Failing that, FTP into the directory wp-content/updraft and look for it there.

If you know how, please send your PHP error logs- just the few lines that appear when you run a backup, often the file called error_log, possibly in your wp-admin directory which you can check via FTP. And if you’re a programmer that can debug and send a patch, that’s even better.

= UpdraftPlus runs out of time when it’s trying to backup, after I have left it for some time to give it a good chance. What can I do? =

This problem is probably caused by your account being starved of resources by your (cheap) web host provider. This is far from ideal; although UpdraftPlus supports resuming backup runs right from the beginning to avoid everything having to be done at once, it has its limits. The best thing is to choose a more reputable web host. Failing this, try going into the “Expert settings” and reducing the size at which zip files are split. UpdraftPlus is known to successfully backup websites that run into the multiple-gigabytes on web servers that are not resource-starved.

= If my site gets hacked and the backups don’t work, is there anything I can do? =

Unfortunately not; since this is free software, there’s no warranty and no guarantee. It’s up to you to verify that UpdraftPlus is creating your backups correctly.

* FIX: A regression in 1.16.30 meant that the term_relationships table could have rows missing in the backup if mysqldump was not present/used; this meant that items with multiple terms were only having one relationship backed up (e.g. multiple tags being assigned to one post)
* TWEAK: Adding remote block assets support when editing post from UpdraftCentral
* TWEAK: Rename UpdraftCentral's main and listener classes
* TWEAK: Improve error message when encrypted key given by user for SFTP/SCP remote storage method

* TWEAK: When fetching the site name from the database, process it via wp_specialchars_decode() to remove HTML encodings that WP applied before storage
* TWEAK: Replace uses of php_uname() function with PHP_OS constant when the server where PHP is running on disables the function for security reasons
* TWEAK: When the definition of a VIEW cannot be fetched, report this nicely, do not let it be flagged as a fatal error, and log it in the backup file and log
* TWEAK: Integrate UpdraftPlus and WordPress 5.5 core's automatic update settings
* TWEAK: When a backup resumed, the last successful resumption was incorrectly set as the last successful resumption when an 'alive' event was recorded, rather than a 'useful' one; this deferred some mitigations when there was insufficient progress
* TWEAK: Add another tweak to paid versions' update checking time algorithm
* TWEAK: Add "Select all" and "Deselect all" link texts for bulk selecting/deselecting tables from the database table list on the manual backup dialog

= 1.16.34 - 30/Oct/2020 =

* TWEAK: Remove the now-redundant concept of inner loops from the database table backup routine

= 1.16.31 - 20/Oct/2020 =

* FIX: A regression in 1.16.30 meant that tables with integer primary keys which used signed integers omitted the first row of the table from the backups. This is not common (e.g. it does not affect any core WP tables; most plugins adding tables follow WP core in using unsigned integers for primary keys).

= 1.16.30 - 15/Oct/2020 =

* PERFORMANCE: Where a table has a numerical primary key, extract its data using that index. This results in a substantial performance increase when fetching large tables using PHP. (The filter updraftplus_can_use_primary_key_default can be used to de-activate this behaviour).
* FIX: Remove incorrect decodeURIComponent() parsing when importing settings, which could prevent import of settings containing some special characters
* FIX: An issue where database tables that were not selected to be backed up in a "Backup Now" backup would get added to the backup during a resumption (i.e. if it did not finish in a single run)
* TWEAK: Catch errors from Google Cloud when the bucket is not found
* TWEAK: Fix undefined variables instead of expected values in message prior to settings import

* TWEAK: Show a notification of UpdraftPlus plugin updates even if the associated user account is not connected to the UpdraftPlus website
* TWEAK: Add mechanism to detect what hosting provider is being used and use it to make UpdraftPlus comply with Kinsta's backup limit policies (thus removing it from the list of disallowed plugins)
* TWEAK: When booting a clone if it's claimed from the clone queue then update the token being used
* TWEAK: Tweaked downwards the minimum time in the future for rescheduling a resumption

* NOTE: The free version 1.16.27 was released as 1.16.26; i.e. if confused about 1.16.26 went, then the answer is that they are the same thing.

= 1.16.25 - 23/May/2020 =

* FIX: Dropbox since 1.16.24 was only deleting one backup files archive out of the set. i.e. Excess archives remained on Dropbox. These have to be deleted manually.

* TWEAK: Update class-udrpc to latest (1.4.14) which removes a conflict with other code that may interact with CORS OPTIONS requests
* TWEAK: Escape log lines when sending for display (theoretically an XSS security issue, but to achieve a successful attack, someone would have to first get something malicious into the log file, which is difficult as there are not many places where foreign input can end up in the log file - e.g. hack into Dropbox and cause Dropbox to send you back malicious HTML in an error message - and then be able to persuade you to both take a backup triggering the problem and then view the log file in your WP dashboard)
* TWEAK: Update Google Cloud bucket locations

= 1.13.4 - 08/Jun/2017 =

= 1.13.1 - 09/May/2017 =

* REFACTOR: Completed re-factoring of the remote storage modules, so that now all remote storage code has completed this current stage of re-factoring (more to come in future - laying the foundation for a significant new feature)
* FIX: Added a nonce to the Dropbox deauth link. This is a minor security issue - someone personally targetting you, who knew that you were logged in to your WordPress admin, and who could persuade you to visit a personally-crafted web page, could cause the connection between UpdraftPlus and your Dropbox to be broken. The only impact of this is that the sending of your next backup to Dropbox would fail, and you would be alerted about the need to re-connect.
* FIX: Import settings now handle the new remote storage options format
* FIX: The zip file browser was not working in free versions

* FEATURE: Browse the contents of a backup from within your WordPress dashboard, and (with Premium) download individual files from it
* FIX: Fix an issue that could occasionally cause corruption of interrupted Dropbox backups. All Dropbox users are recommended to update asap.
* TWEAK: Remove debugging statement inadvertently left in 1.12.36
* TWEAK: Re-factored remote storage handlers via add-ons so that there was a cleaner and more consistent class hierarchy (preparation for future improvements). N.B. If you subsequently downgrade to an older version of UpdraftPlus, you will need to re-enter the settings for some remote storage options.
* TWEAK: List of checksum algorithms run over backups and logged now includes SHA256, and is filterable (SHA1 now considered deprecated)
