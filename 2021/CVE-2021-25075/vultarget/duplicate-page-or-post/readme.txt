That is why having the ability to duplicate content in WordPress is very useful. Similarly, for recordings, you may also need to work on old drafts and records added on the website. You can simply go into editing it and start working on the recording. However, such a solution is not always suitable. For example, another author may work on it.

There are many options that you can set for duplicating recordings using our plugin. For example, you can set prefix or suffix for copied pages. Or you can clone only the content or title. 

###  Here is the options list of our plugin

*   **Title prefix (prefix is the custom text before the title)**
*   **Copy title**
*   **Title suffix (suffix is the custom text after the title)**
*   **Copy Content**
*   **Copy Excerpt**
*   **Copy Date**
*   **Copy Status**
*   **Copy Featured Image**
*   **Copy Template**
*   **Copy Format**
*   **Copy Author**
*   **Copy Password**
*   **Copy Comments**
*   **Copy Categories**
*   **Copy Tags**

As you can see, there are different necessary and useful options that you need during cloning. First of all you need to configure this options and find what options are really important for you. After that click on save button. After you configured all options, open "All pages" or "All posts". If you move the cursor you will see new option "Duplicate"(after Edit | Quick Edit | Trash | View buttons). Just click on it. That's all, simple and useful.

Have you been in situation where you need to update the design or title for the current recording, but at the same time you don't need to change the content? Of course, you will say that you can use the copy and paste operation and copy all the content, but there is an huge problem in this case, in this way you need to copy templates, featured images and other data. We are sure, that it is not very optimal solution. 

There are a lot of situations when you would like to clone your existing content and make a few corrections in one of the copies. The list of cases when you may need to clone a WordPress recordings can go on and on! Duplicating posts is a pretty useful feature, especially when you are working with a lot of similar materials (for example, products of the same category in an online store). It is useless to spend a lot of time on tricks, when you can just save by simply duplicating the content in one click.
