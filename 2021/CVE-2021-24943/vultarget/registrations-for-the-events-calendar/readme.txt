== Description ==

Collect and manage event registrations with a customizable form and email template. Whether you're holding a meetup, class, workshop, tournament, or any other kind of event, you need a way to handle registration. Our plugin makes managing event registration easy and simple. Even nontechnical users can setup the plugin and start collecting registrations within minutes.

= Parent Plugin =

In order for the Registrations for the Events Calendar to work properly, you need to install its parent plugin, [The Events Calendar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/). (Both are free.)

= Quick to Set Up and Easy to Get Started =

As soon as you install and activate the plugin, you can begin collecting event registrations on the single event page for all of your events. You can also customize the placement of the form on the single event page or on any other page using a shortcode.

= Uses =

The plugin can be used for more than event registration. Here are other things the plugin is currently being used for.

* RSVP for meetings
* Class registration or simple class management
* Sports club registration
* Venue booking
* Webinar sign-ups
* Private instructor booking
* Virtual events

= User-Friendly Features =

* Reduce incomplete event registrations by limiting the entire process to a single page (AJAX form submit).
* Keep your event page uncluttered (your event registration form is hidden initially and revealed by clicking a customizable "Register" button).
* Follow-up with your attendees with a customizable confirmation email.
* Save entries in a database table for easy event registration management.
* Attendees can unregister (cancel registration) using a link sent in an email.

= Highly Customizable =

* Add as many text fields as you'd like to the event registration form.
* Add the event registration form to one of several parts of the page your event is displayed on.
* Choose how the form displays. Reveal on click, pop-up modal window, or displayed fully.
* Display the event registration form anywhere on your site with shortcodes or our event registration Gutenberg block.
* Customize the labels, error messages, directions for your attendees, and which fields are required.
* Customize both the email templates sent to your attendees and the notification email sent to the event manager.
* Limit the number of registrations per event.
* Make event registration for logged-in users only.
* Display a list of current registered attendees.
* Specify a registration deadline (both date and time).

= Powerful Backend Features for Easy Event Management =

* Registrations are saved in the WordPress database, where you can manually add, edit, and delete them.
* Email addresses can be checked for duplicates (this prevents duplicate registrations).
* Get notifications when new registrations need to be reviewed.
* View a breakdown of registrations by event, and browse them quickly in an overview.
* Export your event registrations to a CSV spreadsheet.
* Search event registrations by name, phone, or email.

= Tools for GDPR Compliance =

* [View a breakdown of the tools with screenshots here](https://roundupwp.com/gdpr-compliance-with-registration/#free)
* Search for event registrations filtered by email address.
* Export all collected data attached to an email address whether connected to a user or not.
* Delete individual event registrations or permanently delete all data attached to an email address.
* Require attendees to agree to terms and conditions before registering. Include a link to a terms and conditions page.

= Benefits =

* Simple workflow frees up your time.
* Customizations allow you to add a personal touch.
* Optional display of a registered attendee list builds community.
* Straightforward event registration process provides a world-class user experience.

= Can I limit the number of registrations for an event? =

= Can I add more fields to the form? =

Yes. There is a button to add custom text input fields on the "Form" tab.

= I'm not receiving a notification email or attendees are not receiving a confirmation email  =

Take a look at [our FAQ](https://roundupwp.com/faq/my-confirmationnotification-emails-are-missing/) on troubleshooting this issue as well as instructions for installing an SMTP plugin.

= How do I disable registrations for a specific event? =

By default, registrations are enabled for every event. You can disable registrations for a specific event by checking the appropriate box on the "Edit Event" page or on the "Registrations" tab "Overview" page. You can also disable registrations by default by checking the checkbox on the "Form" tab.

= Can I set a deadline for when registrations are accepted? =

You can configure an offset for how long registrations will be available relative to the event start time or set a specific deadline for each event.

= Can I display a list of event attendees on the front-end? =

Yes. You would need to use the post ID for that event in the shortcode. Example: [rtec-registration-form event=743]

It's likely that you have a javascript error somewhere on that page. Try disabling other plugins or switching themes to see if this corrects the issue.
