## A set-and-forget booking calendar for your rental business

WP Booking System is a simple booking system for WordPress. You will be up and running in just a few minutes. Start receiving bookings from your visitors today! You can create booking calendars and forms, and you can manage your bookings. You can easily customize the booking system to fit your needs!

### Display available dates in your calendar

With just one click you can create the first booking calendar for your holiday home or rental business. Already have bookings made? No worries! You can manually manage the calendar's availability in just a few seconds. Now your calendar is up to date with the latest bookings and available dates!

### Create a form and enable clients to make bookings online

The beauty of this WordPress booking system is that it allows your website visitors to book available dates on the spot through a fully customizable booking form. You can review and manage bookings from the back-end, so you are always in control. You can even set up automatic notifications so you will receive an email when a booking is made. Now you’re all set to receive online bookings.

### Receive and manage bookings

All your bookings are saved in your calendar and are beautifully displayed so you can easily access them and view the booking details.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I embed the booking calendar on a page or post? =

By using the 'Add Calendar' button above the editor, the Gutenberg module, or a widget.

= Will this booking system work for me? =

We're pretty sure about that! We made this plugin as 'flexible' as possible. The booking plugin works with bookings on a per day basis (no time slots). So if you rent something out on a daily basis, then the WP Booking System is a good choice.

= I have another question =
