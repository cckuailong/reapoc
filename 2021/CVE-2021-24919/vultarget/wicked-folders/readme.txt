Organize pages and custom post types into folders.

== Description ==

Wicked Folders is the ultimate tool for managing large numbers of pages and custom post types.  The plugin simplifies content management by allowing you to organize your content into folders.  Wicked Folders does not alter your content’s permalinks or hierarchy giving you the freedom to organize your pages, posts, and custom post types any way you want independently of your site’s structure.

= Features =
* Organize pages, posts, and custom post types into folders
* Control which post types can be organized using folders
* Create an unlimited number of folders and nest them any way you like
* Tree view of folders
* Drag and drop folders to easily reorganize them
* Drag and drop items to quickly move them into folders
* Bulk move items to folders
* Assign items to multiple folders
* Toggle folder pane on or off
* Clone folders
* Resizable folder pane
* Dynamic folders (read more below)
* Search folders
* Display number of items assigned to each folder
* Support for right-to-left languages

= Dynamic Folders =
Dynamic folders let you to filter pages (and custom post types) by things like date or author.  You can even browse pages or custom post types by other categories that are assigned to the post type.  The handy "Unassigned Items" dynamic folder shows you items that haven't been assigned to a folder yet and the "Page Hierarchy" folder lets you browse your pages as if each parent page were a folder.  Dynamic folders are generated on the fly which means you don’t have to do anything; simply install the plugin and enable dynamic folders for the post types you want on the Wicked Folders settings page.  See the screenshots section for an example.

= How the Plugin Works =
Wicked Folders works by leveraging WordPress’s built-in taxonomy API.  When you enable folders for pages or a custom post type, the plugin creates a new taxonomy for that post type called ‘Folders’.  Folders are essentially another type of category and work like blog post categories; the difference is that Wicked Folders allows you to easily browse your content by folder.

This plugin does not alter your page or custom post types’ permalinks, hierarchy, sort order, or anything else; it simply allows you to organize your pages and custom post types into virtual folders so that you can find them more easily.

== Installation ==

1. Upload 'wicked-folders' to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen by searching for 'Wicked Folders'.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
1. Visit Settings > Wicked Folders and enable folders for the desired post types (folder management for pages is enabled by default)

To start organizing your content into folders, go to the Pages screen in your WordPress admin.  Click the "plus" icon in the Folders panel to add your first folder.  To move a page to a folder, hover your mouse over the row of the page you want to move, then click and drag the "move" icon in the first column and drag the page to a folder.  To move multiple pages, check the boxes next to the pages you want to move first.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I installed the plugin, now what? =
The plugin will automatically enable folder management for pages upon activation.  To start organizing your pages into folders, go to the Pages screen in your WordPress admin.  From there, click the "plus" icon in the Folders panel to add your first folder.  Visit the plugin’s settings page at Settings > Wicked Folders to enable folders for custom post types.

= Does this plugin change my page’s or custom post types’ permalinks? =
No, the plugin doesn’t modify pages or custom post types beyond controlling what folders they belong to.

= What happens when I delete a folder? =
Folders work like categories.  When you delete a folder, any pages that were in the folder are simply unassigned from that folder.  The pages are not deleted or modified in any way.

= If I delete a folder will the pages in the folder be deleted? =
No, only the folder is deleted.

= How do I put a page in a folder? =
There are two ways.  The first is to visit the Pages screen, move your mouse over the "move" icon that shows up in the pages list when hovering over a row and drag and drop the page to the desired folder.  Alternatively, you can edit the page and assign folders in the ‘Folders’ meta box in the right sidebar.

= How do I put a page in multiple folders? =
You can copy a page to multiple folders by holding the Shift key while dragging a page to a folder. This will keep the page in the current folder while also assigning it to the new folder. You can repeat this step to assign the page to as many folders as you want.

= How do I remove a page from a folder? =
Edit the page and uncheck the box next to the folder you want to remove it from in the ‘Folders’ meta box in the right sidebar.

= Can the folder pane be hidden? =
Yes, to hide the folder pane, click the 'Toggle folders' link (near the bottom of the admin menu on the left side of the screen). To unhide the folder pane, click the 'Toggle folders' link again.

= Can the folder pane be resized? =
Yes, hover your mouse over the vertical grey hairline divider line between the folders and posts and then click and drag to resize.

= Can I organize my media library using folders? =
Media library folders is a premium feature available in Wicked Folders Pro.  [Learn more](https://wickedplugins.com/plugins/wicked-folders/?utm_source=readme&utm_campaign=wicked_folders&utm_content=media_faq_link).

= Can I organize Gravity Forms entries and forms into folders? =
Yes, the pro version of the plugin, Wicked Folders Pro, adds folders for Gravity Forms entries and forms.  [Learn more](https://wickedplugins.com/plugins/wicked-folders/?utm_source=readme&utm_campaign=wicked_folders&utm_content=gravityforms_faq_link).

= Can I organize WooCommerce products, orders, and coupons into folders? =
Yes, the pro version of the plugin, Wicked Folders Pro, adds folders for WooCommerce products, orders and coupons.  [Learn more](https://wickedplugins.com/plugins/wicked-folders/?utm_source=readme&utm_campaign=wicked_folders&utm_content=woocommerce_faq_link).

= Can I organize TablePress tables into folders? =
Yes, the pro version of the plugin, Wicked Folders Pro, adds folder support for TablePress tables.  [Learn more](https://wickedplugins.com/plugins/wicked-folders/?utm_source=readme&utm_campaign=wicked_folders&utm_content=tablepress_faq_link).

= How does the "Page Hierarchy" folder work?
The "Page Hierarchy" folder (found under "Dynamic Folders") is a dynamic folder (meaning it's generated on the fly) that lets your browse the hierarchy of your site as if each parent page was a folder. For example, imagine you have two pages ("Child A" and "Child B") that are assigned to a parent page (called "Parent Page"). In that case, expanding the "Page Hierarchy" folder would show a folder labeled "Parent Page" and, clicking on it, would filter the list of pages to show you the pages assigned to that parent (in this case "Child A" and "Child B").

= I toggled the folder pane off and now I see none (or only some) of my pages.  What happened? =
It's possible your pages are still filtered by a specific folder.  Toggle the folder pane back on, navigate to 'All Folders', and then toggle the folder pane off again.

= If I deactivate the plugin, will my folders still be there if I reactivate the plugin later? =
Yes.  The plugin does not delete the folder data when it is deactivated or uninstalled.

= Can I organize my folders in a specific sort order? =
Yes.  To sort folders in a specific order, click the 'Settings' button (i.e. the button with the cog/gear icon) in the folder pane toolbar and set the 'Organization Mode' to 'Sort'.  When in 'Sort' mode, you can move folders up and down to sort them the way you want.  When finished, change the 'Organization Mode' back to 'Normal' to be able to organize your folders by dragging and dropping into other folders.

= Why are some of my folders grayed out? =
When you search folders by keyword, folders that don't match the keyword are greyed out so that folders that do match the search term stand out.  Delete the text in the folder search field to return the folders to their normal non-greyed-out state.

= Can I set permissions to control who can manage folders? =
Yes, folder permissions are available in Wicked Folders Pro.  [Learn more](https://wickedplugins.com/plugins/wicked-folders/?utm_source=readme&utm_campaign=wicked_folders&utm_content=permissions_faq_link).

= Why is the folder toggle arrow greyed out? =
The folder toggle arrow is greyed out when a folder doesn't have any child folders.  This is done to help you more easily determine which folders have child folders.
