	<br><br><strong>'.__('MScan 2.0 General Info', 'bulletproof-security').'</strong><br>'.__('MScan 2.0 scans WP Core, Plugin and Theme files using file hash comparisons, which is 100% accurate vs conventional pattern matching, which is typically around 75% - 85% accurate. MScan scans all other website files (non-WordPress files) using conventional pattern matching scanning. The pattern matching code is much more extensive in MScan 2.0 and will hopefully achieve a 95% or higher detection rate. False positives are inevitable when using conventional pattern matching scanning, but since MScan 2.0 uses file hash comparison scanning for all WP Core, Plugin and Theme files then there will not be any false positives detected for any/all WordPress files (WP Core, Plugins and Themes). MScan 2.0 automatically downloads WordPress, Plugin and Theme zip files, extracts the zip files, creates file hashes for all files and then deletes the zip files. WP Core, Plugin and Theme zip downloads only occur on the first MScan scan or when a new WordPress, Plugin or Theme version is installed/updated on a website.', 'bulletproof-security').	
	
	'<br><br><strong>'.__('Scanning Other WordPress Sites', 'bulletproof-security').'</strong><br>'.__('Website folder checkboxes cannot be checked for other WordPress sites under your hosting account. To scan other WordPress sites under your hosting account run MScan 2.0 from each site. There are several technical reasons for doing this: Each site may have a different version of WordPress installed and different Plugins and Themes installed. MScan 2.0 now uses file hash comparisons for each individual site based on the WordPress, Plugin and Theme versions installed on each individual website.', 'bulletproof-security').

You will see this message instead of the total number of files scanned whenever new or updated Plugins or Themes need new Hash files created. Run another scan to scan the new/updated Plugin and Theme files.

To fix this problem you will need to use FTP or your web host control panel file manager and delete all folders and files in the /plugin-hashes/ folder except for this file: plugin-hashes.php.
