To begin creating your first feed, navigate to **Feeds** page of Instagram Feed plugin. This page of our Instagram HTML plugin contains a list of all your feeds created with the plugin. You will see the feed of your Instagram timeline appearing on this list.

Press **Add New** button to start building your feed and import Instagram posts to your WordPress website.

Firstly, make sure to set a **Feed Title** for your feed. Then, let's configure the mandatory settings which are necessary for displaying the feed. Click on **Media** bar to expand these options.

Use **Feed Media** drop-down box to choose the content of your Instagram feed. **Feed Usernames and Hashtags** option lets you input your Instagram username and display feeds containing images and videos of your account. You can also add **hashtags** and showcase your posts with those hashtags.

Write the usernames without the **@** sign, however for hashtags, you do need to add **#** at the beginning.

While using this Instagram media importer tool, make sure to specify one username or hashtag at a time, and press **Add** button each time.

You can customize the **sorting** of the media on your feed using the following settings.

  * **Redirect To Instagram.** This option will redirect users to the same post on Instagram when they click on an item in the feed.
  * **Custom Redirect.** Select this option and specify a link in Redirect URL input box. Users will be taken to this page after clicking on a post in the feed.

= What layouts can I use to showcase my Instagram feed? =

Instagram Feed plugin provides 4 beautiful layouts, which you can use to showcase the photos and videos on your Instagram feeds. Each of them can be fully personalized to fit the style of your website.

  * Thumbnails,
  * Masonry,
  * Blog Style,
  * Image Browser.

Let's go through all 4 layouts and help you choose the one that suits your site the best.

**Thumbnails Layout**

**Thumbnails Layout** of Instagram Feed plugin provides an equally aligned beautiful Instagram grid, consisting of the thumbnail images of the media on your feed. All thumbnails on this layout are set to have the same dimensions, and you can assign the width and height you like.

**Masonry Layout**

Just like Thumbnails, **Masonry Layout** is also built with the thumbnail images of Instagram posts. However, its Instagram grid is not aligned equally. The thumbnail images are created as the exact miniatures of their large versions (i.e. the dimensions of thumbnails and large posts are proportional).

**Blog Style Layout**

**Blog Style Layout** is a perfect choice if you want to post a media file on Instagram and repost the content to WordPress website as a photo blog. The images are displayed with larger dimensions, than on Thumbnails and Masonry Layouts.

You can enable captions, descriptions, and hashtags of the media and show them below the posts on your feed.

**Image Browser Layout**

Just like Blog Style, **Image Browser Layout** of Instagram Feed plugin also displays the posts with larger dimensions. However, this layout shows a single large image with navigation buttons, similar to a slideshow. You can navigate through the posts by clicking on **Next** and **Previous** buttons.

= How can I personalize the features of my Instagram feed? =

Instagram Feed social plugin comes with a number of advanced customization options, which you can use to change the functionality and features of your feeds. You can modify the feed as far as:

  * Standard (640 pixels),

  * **Instagram Media Link.** You are able to filter using the shareable link of Instagram media. Simply provide the full URL of the post, as the following example: https://www.instagram.com/p/Be6H6G9lmCQ/

Afterwards, select the **Condition Type** for the filter, which corresponds to the parameter you are adding. For instance, in case you are adding #liveauthentic hashtag, the **Condition Type** needs to be set as **Hashtag** as well.

Lastly, click **Add Condition** button, and the parameters you have added will be visible below **Result** section. Make sure to press **Save** after you finish configuring the filters.

Firstly, you need to assign custom **wdi_feed_loaded** event of the plugin to the container of the Instagram feed, then set callback function for this event.

Here is an example of a script, which expands captions of posts with 0, 1, 2, 3 indexes:

`jQuery('#wdi_feed_0').on('wdi_feed_loaded',function(){
  jQuery('.wdi_photo_title').eq(0).trigger('click');
  jQuery('.wdi_photo_title').eq(1).trigger('click');
  jQuery('.wdi_photo_title').eq(2).trigger('click');
  jQuery('.wdi_photo_title').eq(3).trigger('click');
});`

Make sure to **Save** Changes after you finish modifying Advanced Options.
