- We follow the instructions of the README:
  1) We start the docker container.
  2) The container will be ready when we see the LIFERAY text.
     Now.Let's start the other two commands.

  3) We open liferay at the address (discovered) on the browser.
  4) We create a new user and modify the data to insert our script. Let's add the user to the site.
  5) We enter as admin (admin@liferay.it, admin), on the left in membership, click on the modified user to deepen his information. The script starts.

As it is possible to notice, the attack worked because the page has been build
in order to wrongly parse the text as HTML code.
