Payment Form for PayPal Pro for accepting credit cards directly into your website without navigating to a PayPal page. Official Paypal Partner.

== Description ==

This plugin is for integrating **PayPal Pro** to accept credit cards directly into your website without navigating to a PayPal hosted payment page. 

The PayPal integration available in this plugin **requires a PayPal Pro account**. 

If you aren't sure if you have a **PayPal Pro account** or if you are looking for a classic **PayPal Standard** integration then use the [CP Contact Form with PayPal](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/cp-contact-form-with-paypal/) plugin. 

You can check the differences betwen **PayPal Pro** and **PayPal Standard** at https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/compare-business-products

**Special note:** This plugin has been developed by an Official PayPal Partner and it includes a special offer: Your PayPal Pro account fee will be waived by PayPal when you use this extension to accept the payments.

With **Payment Form for PayPal Pro** you can insert a form into a WordPress website and use it to process credit card payments **directly into your website** without navigating to an external payment page.

This plugin uses the PayPal Pro API to process the credit cards. The credit card related data is used only to process the payment through the payment API, it isn't stored in the website for keeping it secure.

Once the user has filled the form fields and clicks the submit button the payment is processed and the posted data (excluding the credit card related information) is saved into the WordPress database. The website administrator (the email indicated from the settings) will receive an email with the form data and the user will receive a confirmation/thank you email.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

http://wordpress.dwbooster.com/forms/paypal-payment-pro-form

= Q: Where can I publish the PayPal Pro form with the PayPal button? =

A: You can publish the PayPal contact forms / PayPal button into pages, posts and as a widget in the sidebar.

= Q: I'm not receiving the emails after PayPal payment. =

A: Try first using a "from" email address that belongs to your website domain, this is the most common restriction applied in most hosting services.

If that doesn't work please check if your hosting service requires some specific configuration to send emails from PHP/WordPress websites. The plugin uses the settings specified into the WordPress website to deliver the emails, if your hosting has some specific requirements like a fixed "from" address or a custom "SMTP" server those settings must be configured into the WordPress website.
