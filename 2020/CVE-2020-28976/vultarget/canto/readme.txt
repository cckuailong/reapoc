Easily find and publish your creative assets directly to wordpress without having to search through emails or folders, using digital asset management by Canto.

== Description ==

Easily find and publish photos, images, and any other web-safe media file from directly to your WordPress website. Simplify collaboration with your creative team by retrieving media without having to search through emails or folders.

You can browse your Canto Library using the folder tree-menu to quickly find files saved within Albums. Or use the Global Search to find exactly what you need by searching for text within filenames, descriptions, comments, keywords, tags, and even by the name of person who uploaded it.

Define your size, alignment and link options as you normally would. Once you click to insert the image, it will be automatically saved locally to your Wordpress Media library. This will ensure it is indexed by Google for SEO within your permalink structure, and also saved when you backup your website or cache images on a CDN.
